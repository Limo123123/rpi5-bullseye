# Raspberry Pi 5 Bullseye
This is an Image for the Rpi 5 with the Old Bullseye System. But the image is Pi4 Compatible

# What Works?
- Mesa Drivers - No - Disabled in Config.txt to see the Desktop
- Terminal - Yes -
- File Manager - Yes -
- Pi Desktop Button - No - Could be from the Mesa Driver
- Chromium-Browser - No - Don't work because Mesa Driver
- Other Desktop Icons, z.b. Wlan, Bluetooh - No - Could be from the Mesa Driver, Except four Volume

# Mesa Drivers
The Problem is that the Mesa Drivers from Bullseye are too old.
You can uncomment them in the Config.txt.
If you have any Ideas to fix that go to the Issues page.
